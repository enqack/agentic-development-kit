# Walkthrough - 0000_TEMPLATE

This is a template walkthrough placeholder.

- Purpose: satisfy CI evidence gating for code changes in the template repository.
- Action: none (template artifact only).
- Next step: create a real run directory with a real plan + walkthrough once work begins.

Evidence: docs/exec/runs/0000_TEMPLATE/implementation_plan.json
