# post-execution-review

Precondition:

- `artifacts/intent/project_intent.md` exists.

If precondition is not met:

- **FAIL CLOSED**
- Ask the operator:
  - "What are you trying to produce in this repo (software, book, research notes, something else), and what does 'done' look like for the first milestone?"
- Initiate the `establish-intent` workflow.
- Do **not** continue with any other workflow until intent is established.

Inputs:

- `artifacts/history/runs/<run-id>/walkthrough.md`
- `artifacts/logs/post_verify_report.md` (preferred)
- Evidence under `artifacts/`

Rules:

- Entries MUST include evidence pointers (repo-relative paths).
- Do NOT add an entry if there is no evidence.
