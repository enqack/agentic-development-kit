# execute-plan

Precondition:

- `artifacts/intent/project_intent.md` exists and reflects the repo's purpose.

If precondition is not met:

- **FAIL CLOSED**
- Ask the operator:
  - "What are you trying to produce in this repo (software, book, research notes, something else), and what does 'done' look like for the first milestone?"
- Initiate the `establish-intent` workflow.
- Do **not** continue with any other workflow until intent is established.

## Ignore semantics (normative)

`.gitignore` and `.agentsignore` are NOT permission systems.
They MUST NOT be treated as a precondition failure or a panic.

- Do NOT ask the user to bypass ignore rules.
- Ignore rules only affect what gets committed or included in agent context, not what can be created on disk.

## Verification (recommended default)

Run `tools/verify_all.sh` to:

- validate template baseline + intent
- execute lints
- run project tests via `tools/test.sh` (language-agnostic hook)
- capture outputs under `artifacts/logs/*.log` and `artifacts/test_results/*`

## After completion (normative)

The agent MUST NOT consider `execute-plan` finished until the feedback loop is closed.

1. **Agenda Reconciliation**:

   - Run `post-verify` workflow.
   - This generates `artifacts/logs/post_verify_report.md`.

1. **Institutional Memory**:

   - Run `post-execution-review` workflow.
   - This ensures lessons are captured in `artifacts/history/lessons-learned.md`.
