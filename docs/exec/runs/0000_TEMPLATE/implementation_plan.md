# Implementation Plan - 0000_TEMPLATE

**Hypothesis**: Provide baseline run artifacts required by CI evidence gating.

**Status**: template

**Operating Mode**: template-baseline

## Notes

This run exists so that new repositories created from this template pass CI even before the first real
execution run is committed.

The first real run should be created under:

- `docs/exec/runs/YYYY-MM-DD_<RUN-ID>/`

and may replace or supersede this template run.
